# JavaScript Variables

The old way to declare JavaScript variables was with the var keyword:

```js
var myString = "hello";
```

Nowadays you can also use const and let.

```js
const myString = "hei";

let myString = "hi!";
```

There are differences between all of these but we will get those later.

# Simple function components

We are going to use ES6 modules `import` and `export` statements to split our code up into small, manageable files, or "components".

We'll use [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html) so we can easily use all ES6 features with no configuration. It will also allow us to use Sass without needing anything else.

Our components will simply be functions that take argument(s) and return HTML using template literals.

More on functions [here](./README.md) and template literals [here](../variables/innerHTML-loop.md) (method 2).

## Parcel

Run

```js
npm install -g parcel-bundler
```
